Task Force 338 is an ad-hoc group focused on doing University projects led by SpiralNuggets.

We live in a low income university environment that goes by the government name of "King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang". Me and a group of my allies control certain areas of this campus in order to run our legitimate business. We possess virtual reality firearms, two-wheeled electric vehicles, mind-altering Vtuber videos and only use money transfer for financial purchases. If anyone would like to settle unfinished altercations, I will be more than happy to release my address. I would like to warn you; I am a very unhinged person and I regularly disobey the professors, who happened to be my payroll.
